##ECAL Workshop - Hybrid Sculpture

In this workshop we will explore the concept of a hybrid sculptures -- creating works that use technologies such as augmented reality, computer vision, virtual reality and optical illusion to create hybrid physical-digital sculptures. Beginning with the physical  -- an everyday object, a built or fabricated structure, raw materials, a space -- what story can the digital tell about it? Where did the materials come from, what resources were destroyed in its creation, what unseen forces or worlds move around it, what past or future does it have? The works can take many forms --  formalist, political, poetic, provocative, abstract or playful.
